# TheOffice-TextBasedGame

## Overview
A text-based game created with inspiration from the famous Sitcom 'The Office'.
This project was completed for the class IT140: Introduction to Scripting, in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Sumarize the project
This was the final project for the class IT140: Introduction to Scripting to showcase the skills I aquired in the class. The project required me to create a text-based game that allowed the user to move in and out of up to 6 different rooms while gathering items to enter the final room and win the game. The creative aspect was up to me, and I chose to base the game off of the famous TV show 'The Office'. The objective of my game specifically is to gather all the staff members in the office before heading out for an all-staff outing.

## What did you do particularly well?
I feel as if I kept the project very organized and simple with a sufficient amount of comments for other users to be able to understand what each element was in my code. 

## Where could you enhance your code?
The biggest thing I could do to enhance my code would be to possible add more elements to the game itself. There are many additional features I would have loved to add, but do to submitting this for an assignment I followed the set guidelines very closely. Looking back at this project now, when I have some free time I may go back and add some more features to this game. Like possibly a another level after the first portion of gathering all the employees is completed. 

## Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this?
Yes, at the time I struggled with how I was going to be able to code the character from room to room efficiently. My initial thought was to add TONS of if elif statements for every room possibility, but then I was exposed to nested dictionaries/lists and it all clicked for me. With the use of lists/dictionaries text based games can much more efficiently be coded in my opinion opposed to writing tons of if statements. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other project and/or coursework?
Just like I discussed in the previous question the use of dictionaries and lists in this project definitely made me more comfortable using them in the future. Just coding this project in general made me feel more comfortable with the coding process. This was one of my first projects I actually completed so it really felt good to get one under my belt.
